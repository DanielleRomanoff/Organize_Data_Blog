    "The purpose here is not to find a correlation between any features in this dataset. It's to understand how to manipulate the data so it's readable, easy to understand, usable to discover possible correlations between features, and make predictions based on the cleaned up data. That said, I thought while explaining this process, I'd use a dataset that is near and dear to my heart. Soccer is most definitely my favorite sport. I grew up playing and had an incredible coach that brought the best out in me, encouraged my natural competitive nature, taught me the skills I needed, and continued to fan the flame even as I went through high school. I am still in touch with him today. Everybody should have the opportunity to have such a great influence in their lives.\n",

    "Moving on as that is not the point of this exercise. Have you ever wondered how the commentators at sporting events come up with specific stats on players as the game is being played? Yes, the obvious answer is someone behind the scenes feeds them the information. But, where does that person get the information from? People are not sitting there during a sporting event going through statistics by hand. Rarely if ever would a person find the right statistic for the right situation if having to manually find the relevant numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the numbers is also not enough. Multiple statistics are needed to make comparisons to past games, to know if an athlete has broken a world record or even broken their own record. How many times has a situation like the present one occurred? For instance, how many times has a penalty shot, during the regulation time while it was raining, gone in the net? That is a rather obscure statistic but believe it or not, commentators have presented crazier statistics than that example. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, where did all those statistics come from? Though we know it's someone that works with data, I'm referring to a more specific question. How does the person working with the data arrive at these statistics to give the commentators. That is what I will explain here. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to accomplish that. Today, I will show you a basic way to be able to put the data in a readable format, clean it up, and group together features that might be connected."
